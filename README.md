## CodeX : An AI Code Editor

To use this code editor, You have to first clone the repository and then get a Free API Key from OpenRouter and then replace the API Key in the `js/apiClient.js` file.

To run it locally, You have to install the dependencies and then run the server.

python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Access the editor at `http://localhost:8000`

I have used Judge0 IDE to Build this Code Editor.

[**Judge0 IDE**](https://ide.judge0.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.
